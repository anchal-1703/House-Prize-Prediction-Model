# 🏡 House Price Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning-based **House Price Prediction** model developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to accurately predict the prices of houses based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Load the house dataset (CSV, Excel, etc.)

2. **Data Exploration**  
   Understand the data distributions, correlations, outliers.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize/standardize features.

4. **Model Training**  
   Train ML models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate performance using R² Score, RMSE, MAE.

6. **Prediction**  
   Make predictions on new house data.

## 📊 Sample Results

| Feature | Actual Price | Predicted Price |
|:-------:|:------------:|:---------------:|
| 3 BHK, 1500 sqft | $300,000 | $295,000 |
| 4 BHK, 2200 sqft | $450,000 | $460,000 |
